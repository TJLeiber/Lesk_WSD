Another Collio white of real class is the 1990 Pinot Bianco from Vittorio and Giovanni Puiatti (91.16 from Winecellars 081 871 3979). The Pinot Bianco grape usually shows more character than the Pinot Grigio. In the hands of Puiatti, this Pinot Bianco is a stunning wine with a tight vinous concentration and considerable elegance  and is a real rival to top-flight St Vran which costs much the same. Try it with grilled sea  <head>bass</head>  and fennel.

It goes without saying that you start with the bottom step, to prevent the concrete falling through to the one below. Once filled, the sides and riser were gently tapped with a hammer for a couple of minutes to expel trapped air, which can cause surface voids. As each tread was scraped flush and tamped, we moved up to the next; when the surface water had run off, the step could be finished. We made the non-slip surfaces by stippling the tops with a  <head>bass</head>  broom  a fairly new one works best.

Like many young American composers he studied with Nadia Boulanger, but after 1925 set out to achieve the discipline of spontaneity which he found in Stein's writings. When he collaborated directly with her in opera the result was of historical significance. First came Four Saints in Three Acts, produced in 1934, and then The Mother of Us All (1947), which demonstrated a new kind of plotless opera only now reaching a wider currency through the stage works of Philip Glass. In Four Saints Thomson's informality was given free reign since he first of all improvised the music at the piano then, when it stuck, wrote it down to a figured  <head>bass</head> .

Ives's Three Places in New England also had a philosophical, meditative character, rather than a passionate or temperamental one. The march tunes heaped up with proper brashness and a wild final acceleration, but the collage until then kept a rare sense of harmonic direction.

The ingredients were just right: three highly intelligent soloists (Lynne Dawson, Anthony Rolfe Johnson and David Wilson-Johnson); a small but alert choir (excellently trained by Julian Clarkson); a top-name period-instrument orchestra; and a conductor not afraid to cherish every aspect of Haydn's extraordinary score. This was music-making of a high order. Mackerras's account was compassionate but redblooded, direct but full of charm. It did not set out to be radically different, though Haydn's colourful scoring was certainly enhanced by the use of period instruments (including a fortepiano in the recitatives and a  <head>bass</head>  line reinforced more consistently by bass trombone and contra bassoon), but it succeeded in being unforced and unfettered.

With modern knowledge, we now know that this design of horn would have reflected more sound than it captured! For years, the technique was kinder to the voice than to most musical instruments.

Both the extreme  <head>bass</head>  and the extreme treble were lost, so most of the standard drum-kit (which normally provides the rhythm above and below the pitch of the instruments carrying the melody) was banned from the studio.

As a result Camberwell was at this time one of the most fertile art schools in Britain. One who arrived soon after the war ended, to study illustration on an ex-serviceman's grant, was Humphrey Lyttelton. His pen-and-ink drawings provided Minton with unrelieved amusement, as Lyttelton has recalled:  Humphrey Lyttelton's presence at Camberwell helped make it a centre for the beginnings of trad, a jazz revival which replaced the polite and effete noise which had hitherto passed for genuine jazz with a new vitality and energy. At Camberwell Bobby Hunt formed the Bob Hunt's Ragtime Band (Bobby on trumpet, Oska on trombone, Monty Sunshine on clarinet, Terry Arthurs on piano and Denis (Pip) Piper on a one-string  <head>bass</head>  made out of a wooden box and a broomhandle) and which rehearsed at lunchtime in the pottery room, Minton helping some of its members to buy their instruments. So they tried to revive their warlike spirits, while the women rubbed and slapped their heavy limbs and applied ointments to the survivors' burns and bruises. It was full dawn, a silver-grey dawn of the late days of spring, and it was still cool by the water's edge. The wounded who were carried in from the attack on the Rebecca  lay in the shade under the trees while their hurts were being dressed. By the creek, the main force of the islands' fighters was gathered for the simultaneous assault on Belmont, which was shaking the ground even at this range, like the bass drum of a ceremonial band.

The Agnus is naturally the culminating variation; in Misericorde the four parts are expanded for it to six. Even when the highest part of a secular model was more obviously tuneful than that of Misericorde au martir amoureulx  as we shall see, such songs were very fashionable in Paris at this time and the composer took few pains to disguise it (e.g. Gombert's Mass Je suys dshrite on a chanson attributed in the earliest source, Attaingnant's Trente chansons musicales (Paris, 1533) to Lupi, in later ones to Pierre Cadac), the  incongruence evidently did not disconcert contemporaries. Clemens was not content to borrow Pierre Sandrin's very popular Doulce memoire (first published in the first book of Moderne's Le Parangon des chansons (Lyons, 1538)) for the Sicut erat of his first Magnificat Primi Toni; he based every section of his Magnificat Octavi Toni on a chanson, actually drawing attention to their titles in his superius part:  The first five notes of Clemens's  <head>bass</head>  are indeed those of the plainsong eighth-tone Magnificat, but his superius is identical with that of Sermisy's C'est une dure despartie except that it does not follow Sermisy's repeat of the first two phrases and does repeat his last phrase.

Is it possible to observe formal principles with a mind preoccupied with spontaneous composition? It is certainly difficult to improvise well and keep to precise forms, because this means being able to remember and replay what we have played before. Nevertheless, it is important to achieve a semblance of coherent form. There are a few solutions, such as improvisation on a ground  <head>bass</head> , on a theme, or using a skeleton harmonic framework as in jazz.

Very high altitudes can also be attained by the employment of natural and artificial harmonics, but here again the use of these is the exception rather than the rule, and a good deal of practical knowledge of string technique is required for their safe and appropriate use. Those who wish to avail themselves of all the different kinds of harmonics possible will find the information they require in the larger text books of orchestration. We are more concerned here with what might be called the roast beef of scoring than with the confectionery. The normal layout of the string orchestra is in four-part harmony, the double  <head>bass</head>  either doubling the cellos or being silent. We would here stress the importance of giving plenty of rests to the double basses. Few things are more fatiguing to the ear than the incessant doubling of the bass at the octave below, in season and out of season. No organist in his senses would use sixteen-foot tone throughout an extended work, so why should the orchestrator? We would advise the beginner never to write his cello and bass parts on the same stave: if he does, he will almost surely fall into the error of over-using the double bass, his mind's ear, which acts through his eye, being almost certain to fail to register the lower octave. Moreover, we do not wish to give the impression that the cello and bass always work in double harness: on the contrary, they can be used independently to a quite large extent, though discretion and careful thought are very necessary in this matter, since the basses when used alone tend to sound rather dry, and if their part lies low and is far removed in pitch from the rest of the harmony it is too indeterminate in pitch to give satisfactory support unless it consists of a sustained or better (since the bow is short) a reiterated pedal note. In a quiet harmonic passage, however, in which the bass does not lie extremely low, the double basses may be entrusted with the lowest part. Always think how the passage would look if the bass were written at its true pitch instead of an octave higher.

There's also, of course, an output for a pair of stereo speakers that is capable of providing 4 watts per channel and a joystick interface. The only thing missing is the kitchen sink! Sound Quality The synthesis of musical sounds is taken care of by a Yamaha sound chipset capable of stereo output with  <head>bass</head>  and treble equalisation. To get the best out of this setup, it's best to use a decent pair of speakers  the better they are, the better the sound quality. Without getting into the Hi-Fi magazines' territory, using a pair of dual cone active speakers, the sound quality from the on-board synthesiser is very pleasant, with few harsh tones and a definite bass boost being audible. In DOS mode, bass and treble are controlled by a command line mixing facility called PAS which allows the user to control not only the overall volume, but also the relative volumes of mic input, digitised output, synthesiser output, CD output and bass and treble.

In a dream, she saw him skid to a halt, taking in the scene at once as it must have appeared  his brother bending over his fiance  and, thought Sarella in dismay, taking in my submissive expression as I stupidly allow this dark monster to maul me. Furious with herself for allowing such a situation, she pushed Marc's hand away, panting slightly with suppressed emotion at the misunderstandings she knew must follow. A look of confusion had flashed across Peter's face, then he gave a short laugh, a more boyish version of his brother's cynical  <head>bass</head> , and said, So you two are getting to know each other.

The Siberian  <head>crane</head>  stands four and a half feet tall, its brilliant white plumage offset by a blood-red beak, face and legs. Jet-black wing quills are visible in flight. Like most birdwatchers, I have only seen them in pictures -invariably in supremely elegant poses, their long, thin beaks delicately probing the water for weeds. Unlike most birdwatchers, I am lucky enough to live less than four hours' drive from their regular winter home  a wildfowl marsh constructed by one of the Maharajahs of Bharatpur.

It is for this reason whales and hippopotami actually increase their mass to prevent floating. There is also evidence, as we have mentioned before and shall see in the next chapter, of the extensive use of air sacs in sauropods as cooling devices and for reducing mass. Many sauropods, in spite of their ever-growing height spurred on by the need to reach the foliage of trees growing ever higher, had hollowed out, weight-saving  vertebrae and a pelvic girdle described by one writer as being like a suspension bridge, with the massive erect hind legs acting as the down-pillar, and the long torso and rigid tail acting as the cross-span. Indeed, the six-metre long sauropod neck has been likened to a living  <head>crane</head>  for lifting the head to feed, with up to fifteen vertebrae possessing unique extra articulations in the neck to combine strength with agility.

Both The Daleks and The Sensorites featured very elaborate backdrops, all of which Cusick had first to draft out as large, highly detailed colour illustrations long before the day when the Scenic Artist would come in to paint them up. Neither could these illustrations just be rough approximations of the finished articles. The perspectives, the horizon points, the viewing angles all had to be worked out beforehand so that camera shots would enable the backdrops to appear as natural continuations of the sets, instead of suddenly sloping up or downhill. If a  <head>crane</head>  camera was to be used, for instance, it would be no use designing a backdrop with a vanishing point relevant to one of its pedestal mounted brethren. The near, right-hand end-window of the caravan is partially blinded by a crude leaded-light depicting a pink figure with purple beard swimming into the mouth of a big purple fish.

One advantage is that if for any reason the storage system becomes unused the building may be used for other purposes. The racking is constructed on a back-to-back principle up to 20 metres high with intervening gangways as little as 1.5 metres wide. Typical rack lengths are between 100 and 200 metres and number of aisles can vary from as little as 2 to as many as 30. In some systems one  <head>crane</head>  serves more than one aisle and in this case is moved from aisle to aisle by an automatic transfer system. Pallets may be placed away either under manual or automatic control according to the control system chosen. In the case of manual systems one person per crane is usually all that is required to operate that part of the system with in-feed fork- lift trucks being restricted to an access area at the front of the warehouse. Automatic systems usually have an in-feed/out-feed conveyor and sufficient forklift trucks to feed the system  again in each case they are not operating within the crane and storage area. A firm principle with this kind of automatic system is restriction of access to anyone other than maintenance and inventory control personnel, in which case a strict control is kept upon crane operation.

Overall these species are darker, smaller and hairier than temperate counterparts. Darkness and hairiness, especially noticeable in butterflies of the genera Boloria  and Colias , are taken to be adaptations for absorbing and retaining heat during basking. Smallness facilitates rapid warming to working temperatures, though it may also be a symptom of food sparsity; compactness, including relative shortness of limbs and wings, helps to conserve heat and moisture. Wings are short or absent in several arctic species of stone flies,  <head>crane</head>  flies, midges and moths; females are especially likely to have reduced wings and  to avoid flying.

As a result, the whole area became silent, with all big and small trees dead, many of them burned by napalm and excavated by bombs. No forest trees could regrow naturally in these areas. Once the forest cover disappeared, the rain washed the topsoil away, and the land was covered with useless savannah, which we Vietnamese called American grass. As the habitat was reduced, many species of animals that were common before the war now became rare, and many, such as rhinos, tigers, gibbons, douc langurs, pheasants and the eastern sarus  <head>crane</head>  now face extinction.

Andrea used her skills to create a performance piece, Trapeze, in which randomly edited and visually degraded news footage is projected over her suspended body. Entirely encased in a latex bodysuit she becomes anonymous, even androgynous. Hanging limp as a corpse, or straining to hold complex, delicately balanced poses, the elation of her soaring figure is juxtaposed with the very real pain and physical distress incurred. The contorted postures provide an eloquent visual commentary to the simultaneously projected real life imagery; her video and installation work include fragile, barely existing images (negative or miniature projections) of swinging figures, or herself freefalling from a 200 foot  <head>crane</head> , continually repeated, as if caught in a time-loop of seemingly endless motion.

Because China is a vast country with many dialects, certain kung fu schools practise styles that are the same but have different names. The praying mantis style for instance, is known in Cantonese as tong long or won long. The kung fu styles developed at the Shaolin temple were based on the movements of animals. There were five in all, the tiger,  <head>crane</head> , leopard, snake and dragon. In later years one or two animals were adopted, along with their natural movements, to form the nucleus for a complete system of kung fu. The southern Chinese style of hung gar (Hung family) was adapted from the Shaolin tiger system, which also incorporates movements from the white crane style.

The Liebherr LTM 1090 crane replaces a similar capacity vehicle which had been in service at the terminal since May 1982. The all-terrain model offers steering on all its ten wheels, a facility which enables it to be crabbed into position in tight situations. The crane combines its 90-tonne lifting capacity with a fully-extended reach of 67 metres. An onboard computer in the driver's cab provides instant on-screen information about various lift/load configurations. A cut-off device is automatically activated in the event of an overload. Services engineer Jim Hunter, who is responsible for vehicle and plant maintenance on the terminal, told BPXpress: The remote location of Sullom Voe means that having a reliable crane is essential.

 But the most significant point to make is that to attempt to force the fabliaux to fit some standard rhetorical classification is not just (perhaps) irrelevant, but, more seriously, distracting in respect of the frequently clever and significant exploitation of language in these texts. In a fabliau called La Saineresse, The female blood-letter, for instance, the deceptive actions performed by the deceiving character are actions entirely of speech, as a wife who has had sexual intercourse with a man her dull-witted husband believes to be a female blood-letter describes her act of illicit fornication to her duped and satisfied husband entirely in metaphors:  (Sir, thank you by the love of God, I have indeed been in hard labour. I could not be bled and have been dealt more than a hundred blows so that I got a thorough grinding.)

There are, though, some pure place-deictic words, notably in English the adverbs here and there, and the demonstrative pronouns this and that. The symbolic usage of here, as in (70), can be glossed as the Pragmatically given unit of space that includes the location of the speaker at CT. (7) I'm writing to say I'm having a marvellous time here  The gestural usage must be glossed a little differently, as the pragmatically given space, proximal to speaker's location at CT, that includes the point or location gesturally indicated. Note that we cannot eradicate the modifier pragmatically given in these definitions: an utterance of (71) may have quite different implications of precision if said to a  <head>crane</head>  operator in contrast to a fellow surgeon.

The disease has infected animals in at least ten US zoos and can spread through rodents. Diseases such as hepatitis and AIDS are known as emerging viruses, which, although they do not always threaten their original hosts, can destroy entire populations by moving on to new hosts and locations. Human interference has often been responsible for such introductions. In the case of the rare hooded  <head>crane</head> , the introduction of a foreign herpes virus has threatened the remaining wild population.

When my chap turned to confront the Manston sentry  who was on guard with a rifle and one round, and obviously felt that the chap on the wrong side of the wire could be one of those attacking his airfield  my chap said sharply something to the effect: Can you get us out of here? and explained that he only meant his oppoes, not the Stirling. The sentry is claimed to have replied: Now don't abaht, I've got one up the spaht but rushed away to get the orderly corporal who, in turn, found the situation beyond his authority, and we were only released by no less than the duty officer. Later when we were enjoying a beer with the station commander were we nearly disposed of when it was announced that the Stirling had clobbered a Coles  <head>crane</head> , an ambulance, several minor vehicles and the CO's Humber.

Lists Terms often contain lists: for instance, of rights which may be exercised in certain situations, or of facilities to be provided. They may provide considerable scope for disputes over meaning. For instance, if the terms provide that The Supplier shall bear the cost of connecting the goods to the electricity, gas, water and other services who is reponsible for connecting the goods to the telephone network, or to the buyer's internal computer network? Similarly, if the contract provides that  The Customer shall provide such temporary roadways, footways, scaffolding and other equipment as may be necessary for the safe installation of the goods who has to bear the cost of equipment hire if a fork lift truck, or heavy lifting  <head>crane</head> , is needed for the installation?

He had obtained the auctioneer's catalogue only a day before the sale and the purported effect of the clause was to relieve the sellers from telling more than a part of the material facts, thereby obliging the buyer to check the remainder for himself. There are suggestions in the judgment that the decision would have been otherwise had the buyer been a property speculator. This allows a court to adjust its decision according to the other party involved. Such a phenomenon may be illustrated further by the facts in Phillips Products v Hamstead Plant Hire (1985) 4 TrL 98, which involved the hire of a  <head>crane</head>  and driver.

Weldex paid Price Waterhouse, the receiver, nearly 1 million for the business, which had a turnover of 5 million last year. Doug McGilvray, Weldex's managing director, said that at a stroke, the move had removed its biggest competitor in Scotland and doubled its own crane-hire fleet. In terms of general plant, Piper was bigger than us, while we were larger than them as crane operators, he said.

The vessel, affectionately known as a scrubber, is a reactor that ensures no gas by-products from chemical processes are vented to the atmosphere.

Institutions have the pathetic megalomania of the computer whose whole vision of the world is its own programme. This extremely perceptive analysis of the institutional mind fits the police world like a glove, and recent elaborations in policing, along with its growth in the mainstream of the daily social process, supports Douglas's contention (ibid.) that an institution which is dependent upon authority can only demand more of the  same. In such ontological circumstances this allegedly public service must be singularly unsuited to objective assessment of any external demands for a reduction in its power or to encompassing any critical analysis which might cause loss of prestige. Given this premise, we should not be surprised to find the police are in the forefront of support for proposals such as the introduction of identity cards; it was not surprising to find the 1988 Superintendents' Association conference not only supporting this  <head>motion</head> , but arguing for the creation of twenty-four hour armed patrols throughout the country and making a plea for a national motorway squad.

So as the 1980s drew to a close, the sub-sectors dubbed Coal, Construction, Petroleum and Metals were all in fine shape, and their outlook for the 1990s is promising. Not that the eighties were without their problems: quite apart from the industrial recession of the early years, which affected all Railfreight's bulk traffics to some degree or other, there was the historic miners' strike of 19845, taking heavy toll of steel as well as coal carryings. Happily the coal traffic was revived to the point where pre-strike tonnages were exceeded, although the number of individual collieries served was vastly reduced. The merry-go-round system which allows loading and discharge to take place while an entire train remains in  <head>motion</head>  has continued to form the mainstay of Railfreight Coal's operations, and it is difficult to imagine a more efficient alternative.

Speedie should have brought the aggregate level after 25 minutes, but leant back as he met a lay-off by Cyrille Regis, and his shot ballooned over the bar. He is a better finisher than that, of course, and amends were duly made in the 43rd minute when he brought it to 2-0 on the night and 3-3 overall by meeting David Smith's low centre from the left with a 12-yard volley of stunning velocity. Understandably, given their numerical disadvantage, Grimsby made little headway in attack, although Alexander, at 6ft 4in, was of a nuisance value against a defence deprived by injury of Brian Kilcline's aerial authority.

Last week the first practical steps towards such a union were taken when leaders of the RPR, UDF and UDC met and agreed to form a tactical group to work out the most effective means of opposing the government. The first decision of this tactical group was not to table a motion of no confidence during the debate on the bill which sets this year's level of defence spending.

Did it ever occur to you that everything in this world has had to be designed? asks Sir Terence Conran, pausing for the significance of his question to sink in. There is a hint of impatience in the tone of his voice. He is clearly rather tired of preaching the design gospel when it has been evident to him for many years the fundamental role it plays in good business practice. Ever since Conran converted a struggling furniture-manufacturing business into a unique chain of retail shops called Habitat and set in  <head>motion</head>  a high-street revolution, good design has been at the core of everything he has done.

The main innovators of this transformation were not scientists but artists, especially Alberti, Brunelleschi and Leonardo, who created on their canvases and in their architecture and treatises a new conception of space. When I first encountered de Santillana's paper in the late 1960s I found it both fascinating and suggestive. Its attraction arose principally from its iconoclastic message, for de Santillana explained one of the key conceptual innovations in the rise of modern science in terms that challenged the assumptions of my teachers in the history of science. They had argued that the new ideas about space and  <head>motion</head>  had arisen from an intellectual and, to a much lesser extent, empirical critique of the preceding, largely Anstotelian, notions.

Often their private non-political opinion is that the National Front are to be condemned as extremists; but since what the National Front is extreme about is racism, this implies that it is all right to be moderately racist. A reluctance to take a stand about racism, in fact indifference to it, has been shown again and again by head teachers. In December 1977 the Headmistress of St Anselm's School in Canterbury, one of Britain's leading Roman Catholic Comprehensives, allowed a teacher who was a National Front candidate to continue in her post alter she had promised that her National Front views would not affect her treatment to black pupils.

But this good control, plus the fine grip and limited body roll, are badly let down in the driver appeal stakes by the steering. The optional power system should be considered essential, if only to avoid the seriously slow (4.6 turns lock to lock, and vague with it) manual steering that's listed as standard. In its favour, the power system is well weighted and geared, with a much more manageable three turns across the good turning circle. This last point doesn't translate into ideal accuracy and agility, however, for apart from its detached feel it suffers a slow- <head>motion</head>  response.

MP claims that Met fraud squad leaked Fraser report to Lonrho. By Daniel John THE copy of the confidential Department of Trade and Industry report into the House of Fraser takeover which was passed to the Observer newspaper was leaked by officers of the Metropolitan Police fraud squad, it was alleged yesterday. According to a House of Commons  <head>motion</head> , the leak was traced through a system of numbered copies of the 752-page document, which was sent out to the authorities investigating possible criminal proceedings resulting from the report's conclusions. Mr Dale Campbell-Savours, Labour MP for Workington, claims that the leak inquiry, which followed publication of parts of the report in a special edition of the Observer, discovered that copy 26 had been sent to the paper's owners, Lonrho. It is the first time the fraud squad has been directly accused of leaking the report. The MP's motion and three parliamentary questions directed at the Attorney-General, Sir Patrick Mayhew, allege the copy was given to the fraud squad to help its investigations into the successful 615million bid for Fraser by the Fayed brothers in 1985. Two fraud squad officers, Detective Inspector Graham Gooch and Detective Sergeant Ken Morgan, were sent out to Egypt as part of the investigation being conducted alongside an investigation by the Serious Fraud Office. However, they were later taken off the case and transferred to other duties. Mr Campbell-Savours alleges that senior Scotland Yard officers then decided the team should not have any further contact with the Observer or Lonrho. But his motion adds: This House therefore questions why an officer chose to ignore that instruction by meeting the City editor of the Observer at least twice including on the eve of publication of the special edition. The motion goes on to say that it draws the natural and disturbing inference that the meetings and copy number 26 were linked.

It cannot be irrelevant to evangelism that so many unbelievers think the place we give to women in the Church is frankly absurd. He still feared polarisation and the creation of monochrome dioceses where clergy opposed to women priests would leave dioceses where they were ordained, and women ordinands and deacons would leave dioceses where they could not become priests. The legislation would have most impact on the dioceses, and Dr Runcie was anxious the debate should be extended to the grassroots. The  <head>motion</head>  was moved by the Rev Canon John Dale (Worcester) who said it was five years since the request for legislation on women priests was made. The measure as revised by the committee tried as hard as possible to accommodate the views of those who object to women priests. It creates space within the Church from which they can carry on their ministry for up to 20 years. Speaking against the motion, the Rev David Holloway (Newcastle) quoted a Canadian theologian. If it should turn out to be true that God did intend males to exhibit strength in leadership roles and females to excel more as the guardians of society's emotional resources, why should this be viewed ipso facto as an evil arrangement? Mr Michael Oakley (York), supporting the motion, said it was vital the matter was put out to the dioceses.

ATORY MP yesterday wrote to the Home Secretary, Mr David Waddington, the BBC chairman, Mr Marmaduke Hussey, and the IBA chairman, Mr George Russell, demanding an urgent investigation into the preponderance of broadcasting recruitment advertising placed with the Guardian. Mr Graham Riddick, MP for Colne Valley, said he was reminding the chairmen of their duty to political impartiality. It was time for them to put their houses in order, and for the Home Secretary to insist they do. With Mr Norman Tebbit, the former Cabinet minister, he has sponsored an early-day  <head>motion</head> , tabled yesterday and signed by 111 Tories. This says that the BBC and ITV companies place four times as much recruitment advertising in the Guardian as in the Times and Independent. The MPs have concluded this could explain the leftwing bias they allege in some TV programmes. The motion states: To recruit almost exclusively from the narrow minority group of Guardian readers whose views are predominantly leftwing is contrary to the spirit of the obligations of political balance in broadcasting and is an explanation of the self-righteous and unctuous hostility of broadcasters towards the present Government.

As these sites are used up housebuilders have looked further afield to the small towns and villages of southern England which are now within commuting reach of London and the motorway-induced development radiating from it. Counties such as Berkshire, Hampshire, Hertfordshire and Cambridgeshire have been faced with increasing government demands to provide more new housing and this has produced vociferous opposition from local residents who see their traditional communities under threat. Both high income commuters and lower income residents may resent development of this kind: the one because it interferes with their fantasy of the rural life, and the other because it pushes up house prices without providing any new job opportunities. Although some developers provide low cost or rented housing within their schemes, the majority of housing is aimed at the upper end of the market thus setting in  <head>motion</head>  a house price spiral which effectively freezes the locals out of home ownership.

The remedy granted by the High Court is an injunction, a discretionary remedy and a very serious one for the defendants, which may result in closure of the premises without compensation if that is the only way in which the nuisance can be abated. Courts are however reluctant to take any action which will close premises down, as evidenced by the Shoreham  and Cheltenham  cases, in which it was between four and five years after the issue of the original writ that the businesses were finally closed down. It is clear that time will be allowed for improvements to be carried out and only when it is clear that there is no prospect of the business in question being able to operate without causing an odour, which amounts to a statutory nuisance, will the court permit the issue of a writ of sequestration for contempt of court, in committing breaches of the undertaking not to cause a statutory nuisance, thus closing the business down without compensation. Michael Davis, J. who heard the  <head>motion</head>  by Shoreham-by-Sea Urban District Council, in the High Court, for an order that they be at liberty to issue writs of sequestration, held that it was not necessary for the plaintiffs to satisfy the court that the defendants had acted wilfully in the sense of contumaciously, with a deliberate intention to defy the court order, since the Rules of the Supreme Court, 1965, do not contain in Order 45, Rule 5(1), the word wilful.

6 FA Cup Jack Lewis was a brilliant attacking wing-half whom Palace obtained for nothing more than a signing-on fee from West Bromwich Albion in the summer of 1938. Like many players of that era, Jack's footballing career was badly restricted by the war, but he was available to help us to our regional championship of the 3rd Division South in the first half of 194546 while, upon the resumption of League Football in 194647, he shone as a half-back of real quality in a none too great Palace team and his performances quickly drew attention from several 1st Division sides.

The body rests upon a bed of the finest ash, a coating of india rubber, three quarters of an inch in thickness, being placed between, which has the effect of almost destroying the vibration generally attendant on the railway carriages. At either end of the state saloon, and entirely unconnected with it, are small compartments, for each a guard, who has the control of a powerful argand lamp which, on passing through the tunnels along the line, reflects a strong light through a ground glass of globular form inserted in the panelling. The roof of the carriage projects six inches over the body, and rises in the form of a dome towards the centre, where a ventilating apparatus is fixed, surmounted by a colossal gilt crown, which gives a striking finish to the exterior design.

Inevitably, Lioretographs disappeared within three or four years. At the Paris exhibition of 1900 (the one at which Oscar Wilde is supposed to have been recorded), the Columbia company introduced their Multiplex Grand machine, using a giant cylinder played by three styli and horns. We can see from (47) that the cylinder had three soundtracks side-by-side; presumably it was recorded by three cutters side-by-side, in which case the record would have stereophonic     properties.

The source and drain are thus connected by a so-called inversion layer, in which the majority charge carrier (electrons) is the minority one in the bulk of the semiconductor (which is p-type, so holes are the majority carrier). Using a voltage to control the number of mobile electrons in this layer, or induced surface channel as it is sometimes called, is the basis of the device's operation. Interest in the scientific potential of the inversion layer was awakened in the late 1950s. Theoretical considerations indicated that if the electric field applied to the surface could be made strong enough to confine the mobile electrons to a very thin layer near the semiconductor's surface, with thickness comparable to the wavelength associated with the electrons there, then the electrons'  <head>motion</head>  perpendicular to the surface would be quantised.

The Davy lamp was the direct result of the mine owners' concern to recover coal, not from deeper shafts but from existing workings that were inaccessible because of a process known as creep. When the veins of coal were mined, pillars of coal had to be left to hold up the roof of the mine, rather like the pillars in a multistorey car park. The weight of the roof pushed the pillars down and the resulting pressure also forced the floor to buckle and move upwards. The downward  <head>motion</head>  of the pillars and the upward motion of the floor gradually combined to shut off the passageways and close the mine.

Temperatures in such systems reached about 10 electron volts (eV), about 100 000 K. Experiments had shown that the current-carrying ring of hot gas in a simple toroidal pinch was unstable, so that the hot gas (plasma) struck the walls and was cooled far too rapidly. Theoretical research in the United States confirmed that these instabilities were a natural characteristic of the system. This result was interpreted as having some favourable aspects. In particular, the resulting  <head>motion</head>  of the plasma column in the magnetic field  motion that eventually destroyed the containment  might heat the ions in the plasma; also, image currents in  metallic  conducting walls of the torus might limit the  excusions  of the plasma column.

It is tempting to assume that the same rule applies, but quasar redshifts are, in some cases, very much bigger than any measured galaxy redshift, so the assumption involves considerable extrapolation. It is this assumption, however, which is the basis of claims that the most distant quasars known are upwards of 10000 million light years away from us, receding at more than 90 per cent of the speed of light. A few astronomers have raised doubts about this extrapolation from ordinary galaxies to all extragalactic objects. They argue that redshifts can be produced in other ways than through the expansion of the Universe by gravity; by the rapid  <head>motion</head>  of an object, a true Doppler shift that, thanks to relativistic effects, produces a redshift even if the object is moving across the line of sight; or by other, unknown, means.

On no account worry about the following technicalities, but, as with driving a car, it is helpful to know what is under the bonnet. When people talk, air from the lungs is forced through the larynx into the mouth or nose to escape finally into the outside world. When sounds are said to be voiced, they are produced with vibration. This happens when there is a voluntary tightening of the vocal cords which sets vibration in  <head>motion</head>  as the air is on its journey from the lungs.

His debut had been The Subject Was Roses  for MGM in 1968, the film of the Frank D. Gilroy play which, along with a plum Broadway role, was plucked away from Dustin by a pyrotechnical fondue pot.  The first shot in the movie is of Dustin writing a suicide note on the rooftop of the General Motors Building in New York. There was a time when I planned to live for ever, but the time has come to change those plans.

He died while driving a Warrior armoured fighting vehicle escorting a civilian ambulance.

Roy Smith, councillor for Golf Green, Clacton, will be urging Tendring District Council to support his  <head>motion</head>  and express its opposition to Government plans to raise prices. In the last Budget, Chancellor Norman Lamont announced the Government's decision to extend VAT to domestic gas and electricity at 8 per cent next year and at 17.5pc by 1995. Mr Smith's motion, which he will put before the council as soon as possible, says this will increase the weekly bills of all households, but will particularly affect pensioners and others on low incomes. The extra financial burden placed on those least able to afford such rises will inevitably impact on the services provided by this local authority, he said. Mr Smith hopes that his campaign will attract the support of all organisations for the elderly or those on low incomes. His motion is backed by Lionel Randall, last year's chairman of the council.

The church figured in this document only in the same general terms as it figured in Magna Carta; there was one reference to prohibitions, but begging still the question of what were temporalities and what were not. This in itself bears witness to the limits of clerical influence. Although Winchelsey was a leading figure in political opposition to the crown in 1297 and in 131011, his influence on the two occasions differed, for whereas in 1297 both clergy and laity shared a common grievance over taxation, this was not so in 131011.

The script for The Chase, also by Terry Nation, called for Episode One to end with a Dalek rising dramatically out of the sand to menace the time-travellers. On this occasion the Director, against Cusick's advice, decided to do the shot by actually burying a full-size Dalek in a sand pit, the idea being to use a tow rope, attached to a Land Rover, to pull the machine from its sandy grave. The filming crew spent a full morning digging a suitably sized pit with a sloping ramp, filling it in again once the Dalek had been rolled into place. Only when the cameras were rolling was it heart-sinkingly apparent that the physics of inertia, represented by nearly a ton of resting sand, were greater than the physics of  <head>motion</head>  represented by the four skidding wheels of a Land Rover. In order to use any selected function Enter key must be pressed and the function will operate as long as the stylus is depressedreleasing it cancels the function. The single most difficult thing I found when using the Grafpad was to remember whether I was drawing on the screen or mapping the attributes. The current screen mode is displayed in the centre of the information bar so it should be simple to keep track of what's going on but dropping into Attribute mode and spraying colour across pixel boundaries can be very frustrating. The accuracy of the tablet is matched to the Spectrum, the grid inside the tablet's surface consists of a wire mesh 176 by 256, so the movement of the stylus on the screen corresponds exactly to its motion on the surface of the Grafpad.

At this stage in the fire's development, sideways spread is not a problem and can easily be constrained by a good protective system.

The bacteria have, embedded in their cell membranes, receptor molecules  that is, proteins whose molecular architecture enables them to recognize the glucose molecules  and tiny whip-like projections (flagella) which, by beating in unison, can row the bacteria up the glucose gradient. Mutants which lack the glucose receptors fail to show such behaviour, even though they will continue to make use of the glucose as an energy source if placed directly in contact with it. More complex single-celled animals, such as paramoecium, have similar projections, called cilia, connected at their bases by a system of fine threads, which enable the beat of the cilia to be coordinated. Except when it is actually feeding (it eats bacteria), the paramoecium is in constant  <head>motion</head> , frequently bumping into obstacles in its path and, when it does so, reversing by switching the beat of the cilia on one side.

Strichen lies a little way down from the left shoulder of Scotland along which they travelled to reach Inverness. After they left the druids' circle at Strichen, Boswell and Johnson exchanged a number of observations, the first of which had been an expression of compassion for Mr Fraser. Boswell here lets fly with a breath-taking assumption that country folk had a lonely, miserable time: I had a most disagreeable that is to say distressing notion of the life of a country gentleman, and he left Mr Fraser, he said, as one leaves a prisoner in a jail.

Kite, one of the few golfers to have had any success with switch-hitting on the greens, came out this year with a compact whip-and-zip to his swing that made him look like one of those little mechanical Arnold Palmer golf games that were so popular in the 1960s (and have recently surfaced again).

Andrea used her skills to create a performance piece, Trapeze, in which randomly edited and visually degraded news footage is projected over her suspended body. Entirely encased in a latex bodysuit she becomes anonymous, even androgynous. Hanging limp as a corpse, or straining to hold complex, delicately balanced poses, the elation of her soaring figure is juxtaposed with the very real pain and physical distress incurred. The contorted postures provide an eloquent visual commentary to the simultaneously projected real life imagery; her video and installation work include fragile, barely existing images (negative or miniature projections) of swinging figures, or herself freefalling from a 200 foot crane, continually repeated, as if caught in a time-loop of seemingly endless  <head>motion</head> .

Blackwell was an ensign in the City's horse militia as early as 1642 and a cornet in the parliamentary army by 1644; in 1645 he became a captain in Oliver Cromwell's own cavalry regiment, in which he served until June 1648. For most of the time he combined this with the very important post of deputy treasurer-at-wars. A political as well as a religious Independent, Blackwell's appointment may have been intended to reassure the army, since the war treasurers themselves were London aldermen of Presbyterian persuasion. In 1649 the Rump Parliament rejected a  <head>motion</head>  to make him a full treasurer, but in 1652 he became co-treasurer with an obscure backbench MP, and from 1653 with Richard Deane q.v.; they were also joint receivers-general of assessments, and thus responsible for the entire system of direct taxation and military expenditure.

Ronald M Birse , Matthew  (17531781), engineer and inventor, was born at 3 Narrow Wine Street, Bristol, where he was baptized 18 November 1753, the son of Mary and William Wasbrough, originally a barber-surgeon and peruke maker, who was in partnership with Roger Rice in a brass-founding and clock-making business in Narrow Wine Street. He had at least three older brothers. Taking an early interest in his father's work, he constructed a steam engine with which to drive all the lathes and other machines; in order to do this, he had to convert the reciprocating movement of the Newcomen-type beam engine into rotary  <head>motion</head> . He achieved this by using a ratchet-and-pawl mechanism to produce the rotary motion, combined with a flywheel which reduced the otherwise excessive variations in the speed of rotation. On 10 March 1779 Wasbrough was granted a patent (no. 1,213) for a machine, which when applied to a steam-engine or any perpendicular motion will cause such movement to become circular, without the medium of a water-wheel, for grinding wheat and other grain, and for grinding, rolling, hammering, and other uses in mechanical operations. The ratchet-and-pawl device was quite effective in principle, but not robust or reliable enough in constant use, and it seems that, after he completed an engine to drive a mill owned by James Pickard at Snow Hill in Birmingham, it was found to be unsatisfactory, and a crank was substituted. It is not known who suggested this alteration, but anyhow the problem was solved; in the words of John Farey q.v.: The engine then answered so much better than anything which had been tried before that the same principle has been followed ever since. This was probably the first successful application of the crank to a steam engine in order to produce rotary motion. A patent (no. 1,263) was granted to Pickard on 23 August 1780 for a new-invented method of applying steam engines to the turning of wheeles, whereby a rotative motion is performed, and the power of the engine is more immediately and fully applied than by the intervention of water.

Alford made his name as a vigorous and informed opponent of impositions, monopolies, proclamations, and purveyance, and was an inveterate foe of Chancery. Already in 1610 he was one of a select number of the Lower House who met with the lord treasurer, Robert Cecil, first Earl of Salisbury q.v., son of his father's patron, to discuss impositions. He was always reluctant to approve subsidies; in 1621, when other members were prepared to pledge their lives and fortunes to recover the Palatinate, he observed bitterly that the farmers would say, if you will have three taxes in one year, we must have three harvests in one year. Such rhetoric was backed by a proper concern for the freedom and order of the House, down to such details as a successful  <head>motion</head>  (16 December 1606) that the adjournment of a committee on a bill should be announced in the House.

Maximum ozone concentration occurs at a height of 1618 km in polar latitudes and at about 25 km over the equator. This ozone layer is important to society and the environment for two reasons. Firstly, the ozone absorbs solar ultraviolet radiation in the UV-B or 280320 nm wavelengths, thus warming the stratosphere and producing a steep temperature inversion between 15 and 50 km. As temperature decreases with height in the troposphere (reaching -40 to -80 C at the tropopause), the effect of a warm stratosphere is to act as a ceiling or lid to vertical  <head>motion</head>  in the troposphere  that is, convective processes which produce clouds and precipitation are contained within the troposphere.

Some of the most fascinating demi-caractre  ballets are those where the choreographer has sought inspiration from oriental dance. This can be fairly easy to achieve because a brief study of ancient Egyptian friezes shows exactly how to adapt the movements depicted to the turned-out legs of classical dance.

This type of choreography was taken up by later music-hall acts whose very eccentric soft shoe, sand dances before a background of pyramids and  <head>palm</head>  trees aroused much laughter.

Which spirit was responsible for inspiring his prophecies we shall look at in Chapter 13.  <head>palm</head>  reading Palmistry, as practised in seaside booths and council-house sitting rooms, is the study of the human hand to assess the  characteristics and future of its owner. Assemble a handful of palm-readers in one room, and you will end up with an argument. It often seems that there are as many ways of reading hands as there are palmists. One concentrates solely on hand lines (chiromancy) while others are only interested in the form of the hand (chirognomy). One palm reader may deduce her findings from a comparison between lines and hand form, while another may simply use the palm rather as she uses, at other times, a crystal ball. In this case, the hand is simply an autoscope  a stageprop  used to help a medium contact her familiar spirit. Fussing over vertical life-lines, pondering horizontal heart and head lines and anxiously measuring the girdle of Venus and zone of intuition, seems a desperate and futile way to fill the aching emptiness in many a woman's life.

In addition, patterns were most frequent amongst duodenal sufferers in the thenar I (21 per cent compared with 3 per cent) and interdigital IV (54 per cent compared with 45 per cent) areas of the palm.

Performance Notes 1) To achieve a sound similar to that on the record (forgetting, if we can, the unbelievable production quality of this whole album) you should use a fairly distorted amp setting and play the solo using fingerstyle throughout.

This solo is a very good example of Trevor Rabin's playing style, which to my mind always contains an effective blend of taste and melody, combined with a very well-rounded technique. The phrasing in a couple of the sections is a little tricky, so you would be well advised to work through his solo in close conjunction with the record. 2) The muted phrases in bars 2 and 3 should be performed using fairly heavy  <head>palm</head>  muting and a strong pick attack.

When the dry season comes and food is scarce, the active workers of the colony visit this    living larder and caress the repletes with their antennae until they regurgitate droplets for them. Most animals living in lands where there is a flowerless season and lacking a storage system can only treat pollen and nectar as summer supplements to their menus.

However, the cursor can only move in character-sized steps, the user cannot move it directly to its destination. If, in some way, the text cursor could be treated like a graphics cursor, which is free to roam under the control of a joystick or trackball, these ideas could be put into practice. As long ago as the 1960s the possibility of this form of cursor control was being looked at by the Stanford Research Institute in California and the first mouse was patented in 1970. The name was coined simply because of the physical similarities of size and shape; a mouse is small enough to fit into the palm of the hand and usually has ears and a tail to complete the picture.

Martin was a specialist in vast canvases showing the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Belshazzar's Feast with the Writing on the Wall, and such apocalyptic scenes; and his frontispiece is suitably dramatic, though small. In the foreground three dinosaurs, clearly wingless dragons rather than definite species, are fighting in mud or slime, watched by a pterodactyl with its wings spread like a cormorant. Further away two more monsters threaten each other, while in front some tortoises and ammonites show the inhuman scale of the dinosaurs. Curious  <head>palm</head>  trees dot the scene, and the background is immense and desolate, as in Martin's paintings.

A dedication to Cautes indicates the presence somewhere of a Mithraeum. Variations on the theme of Mars also occur, such as Mars Barrex, Mars Belatucadrus and Mars Ocelus, while a dedication probably to Mars Victor was observed by William of Malmesbury still in position on a vaulted building, which was presumably a temple; these dedications are mainly by soldiers. Other deities recorded are the Mother Goddesses, the Fates, Mercury and Hercules, while a small lead statuette of Diana came from the supposed temple site in Keays Lane. Christianity may be represented by a tombstone and a gold ring with an incised  <head>palm</head>  branch and the legend AMA ME, although this religion has more significance in post-Roman Carlisle.

Almost violently, she raised her body, ducking her head at the same time, her feverish lips seeking the scorching lure of his again, the demand for his kiss born out of an intuitive need to let him silence her, so that he might not hear the words and other sounds which would tell him just how complete his dominion of her senses already was. So he swallowed her small cries, but in the end it was not the safeguard she had sought, because in doing so he fed her the taste of himself once more and left a hunger in her which she sensed would last a long, long time, if not an eternity. His hand toyed mercilessly with her breasts, as if he had the right; perhaps she had given him the right; as if he owned her and she existed solely for his capricious use. Hand and fingers so delicately possessive, massaging the swollen flesh, sensually squeezing, kneading, fondling, then  <head>palm</head>  withdrawn, leaving only forefinger and thumb to tug gently at one hardened, burning peak. Maria shuddered convulsively as she felt her nipple rolled between diabolically skilled finger and thumb, the mini-spasm of ecstasy gratifying and tormenting all at once, and ultimately cruelly deceptive because it brought no resolution or peace, only an even deeper hunger that seemed to plumb the deeps of the most secret levels of self. Passion ruled her, admitting no distractions, thought and emotion denied, anything that was known outside her acute physical awareness merely sensed. She did not consciously know that, with Luke's swift co-operation, she had rid him of his tie, nor that she was left unaided to tear at his shirt buttons with frantic fingers; and it was only through her senses that she knew when she came to hard flesh and soft springy hair, her palm sliding damply over his chest, fingers catching luxuriously in the light tangle of hair covering it.

And now that I looked again at Mr White Face, I saw that beneath his paint his face had some of the configurations of a rat, with sharp little jaws and pointed nose, not at all like the inhabitants of Sarawak, a blunt-faced company, with which I was acquainted. Obeying his instruction, I proffered my hand, open  <head>palm</head>  upwards, towards the animal.

Packers anxious reassurance that they are all  portraits (relieving us of the potentially dangerous task of distinguishing those that are not) requires him to identify and locate a sitter or sitters. The evident difficulty of writing about an artist who has transformed the traditional process of mapping a terrain of physiognomical likeness onto the production of a surface that suggests a process of physical disintegration rendered in assertively material terms is resolved by Packer in an oblique but entirely conventional manner. The artist as subject is involved as authority for the authenticity of the subject as sitter and hence also for the legitimacy of the object as portrait. The artist's intimacy with a handful (the possessive act of holding in one's  <head>palm</head> ) of familiar sitters, fixed and therefore by implication immoveable both in the sense that they pose like good models and in the sense that they do not leave, travel or change and therefore have no narratives of their own.

Unemployment, however, was expected to fall from 8.1 per cent in 1988 to 7.9 per cent in 1989 due mainly to increased job opportunities in the manufacturing sector, whose contribution to GDP was estimated to have expanded from 24.4 per cent in 1988 to 25.6 per cent in 1989. Manufacturing output increased by 15.5 per cent in 1988, while manufacturing growth was estimated at 13 per cent for 1989. Agriculture continued to provide a large share of GDP: its contribution in 1989 was estimated to be 20.2 per cent, an increase of 3.1 per cent. Nevertheless, agricultural output showed signs of deceleration due to a steady decline in the international commodity prices of rubber, cocoa and especially  <head>palm</head>  oil which was the subject of a vigorous campaign in the United States to raise public awareness of the relationship between consumption of saturated fats and heart disease.

Towards A.D. 900 refugees coming north from Moslem-occupied Spain settled near Len and established in that area an architectural style part Christian and part Arabic, called Mozarabic. The buildings were based upon late Roman designs but also displayed Oriental features especially in decoration and their use of brickwork in constructional and ornamental forms. A very good example here is the Church of S. Miguel de la Escalada, built as part of a monastery in 91213. This basilica, overlooking the river Esla, is 70 feet long and has a five bay nave separated from the aisles by marble columns with mixed capitals  Roman, Visigothic and tenth century Mozarabic (these last-named are  <head>palm</head>  leaf designs as in the Cordovan Mosque).

Until the mid- and late 1970s, there were simply no rules whereby groupings of parents could obtain a state-financed, multi-denominational school, as the only channels of communication in these matters were those between the Department of Education and the relevant diocesan department or other church board. For example, a new housing estate would be built, the diocese would be informed of the development at the planning stage, and the diocesan office would put in for a school, or an extension for an existing school. The arrangement had been unchanged since the early years of the state and had become entirely natural.

I've often wondered about the origin of Evan's encyclopaedic knowledge on this topic. It is an area of study with a strong academic bias, the foundations of which were nonetheless in local exploration.

THE incineration of PCBs requires a furnace which will hold the material at 1,100C for at least two seconds, in the presence of plenty of oxygen. Companies wishing to enter the waste disposal business at this level must demonstrate to the local Waste Disposal Authority (usually a county council, but in some cities and in Wales a more local authority) that they can meet various criteria, although the authority may be over-ruled on appeal to the Secretary of State for the Environment. Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution is now the custodian of national standards on emissions from such plants, of which Britain currently has three. Rechem can take solid and liquid wastes contaminated with PCBs at its  <head>plant</head>  at Pontypool (30,000 tonnes a year), and liquid wastes (20,000 tonnes a year) at its plant at Fawley, near Southampton. Cleanaway can take liquid PCBs at its Ellesmere Port establishment, where it is building another plant which will take capacity there to 48,000 tonnes annually. Ocean Environmental Management has applied for a 30,000-tonne plant at Seal Sands, Teesside, and is appealing against the local authority's refusal to allow it. Leigh Environmental wants to build an incinerator plant near Doncaster, but also faces local authority opposition, and International Technology Corporation has submitted a joint application with Northumbrian Water for incinerators at Teesside and Tyneside for the incineration of sewage sludge and organic wastes, with a capacity of 43,000 tonnes each.

MANY OF the 60-odd species of slipper orchid, the best known and most popular orchid in the West, could be extinct within 10 years without tough measures to halt the vast illegal trade in wild varieties. The Dutch government is so concerned that at next week's 103-nation conference in Lausanne of the Convention on Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) it will call for a total ban on trade in the plants.

There are more than 40 nuclear reactors and 22,000km of gas pipeline passing through built-up areas. The Siberian pipeline disaster, Chernobyl and Bhopal illustrate the potential risks. But the continuous scrutiny demanded and enforced by regulation of the high-risk cases and (for nuclear reactors) the designs of these installations are considerable forces on the side of safety. One day there will be a serious industrial accident; there are occasional near misses and worse; but it usually takes a good measure of folly, inattention and misfortune to overwhelm good  <head>plant</head>  and a safe system. Relatively few members of the public have been killed in Britain by industrial accidents in recent years. People expect risks they did not ask for and cannot control to be much lower -by 10 or 100 times  than those which they run willingly. People may smoke, drive at 80 miles an hour through fog on a motorway, go in for hang-gliding or rock climbing at the weekends. Yet they see nothing inconsistent with objecting to a well-engineered nuclear waste disposal plant which is clearly necessary to dispose safely of irradiated material already created; or to properly regulated high-combustion chemical waste disposal plants that are the only alternative (unless we get rid of the chemical industry) to toxic wastes being dumped surreptitiously in some field or on some beach.

Michael Harrison, our Industrial Editor, contrasts its performance with that of its foreign counterparts By MICHAEL HARRISON, Industrial Editor FORD'S ageing and ramshackle Dagenham site in Essex, once the jewel in the company's overseas operations, enters the 1990s with its very survival uncertain. The  <head>plant</head>  now dubiously boasts the poorest levels of productivity, quality and working conditions of any Ford factory in Europe. Unless it can effect a remarkable recovery, the factory may well disappear back into the bleak and sodden marshes of Essex from which it emerged nearly 60 years ago. The evidence of Dagenham's predicament can be gauged from internal company documents which illustrate graphically the task confronting Ford and its workforce. These show that it takes Dagenham nearly twice as long to produce a Sierra car as it does Ford's Genk plant in Belgium. The picture is similar when Fiesta production is compared at Dagenham and Valencia. The British plant takes 53 hours to turn out each car, the Spanish factory 30 hours. Product quality at the Essex factory is also inferior, measured against any index, whether it be ratings out of 10, defects per vehicle or warranty costs on each car leaving the factory gate. The Dagenham workforce would argue that there are good reasons why the ageing plant cannot match the performance of its modern Continental rivals. However, the documents also show that Dagenham's car body and assembly operations are failing to meet even its own internal targets. In 1988 the plant was scheduled to produce 992 cars a day.

Certainly, such peace as prevailed owed an immense amount to Jones's personal stature in the movement, as one of the old-style union leaders who had, nevertheless, taken an outward-looking and creative role in trying to relate union demands to a wider pattern of economic stability and also, incidentally, the wellbeing of a Labour government. Jack Jones was an interesting, transitional figure. He was an old leftist who had fought in Spain in the International Brigade. He had grown up in a quasi-syndicalist tradition in the Liverpool docks, and his influence in the sixties had been thrown behind the growth of the shop-stewards movement and local  <head>plant</head>  bargaining on a devolved basis very much on the lines of the 1968 Donovan Report.

The  <head>plant</head>   hospitals, equipment, surgeries  being state-owned and state-administered, those changes do not come about by a gradual process made up of an infinite number of individual decisions: they happen in lurches, of which the most visible form is not the provision of new plant but the discontinuance of old plant.

However complex  the outward manifestations of the religious life may be, at bottom it is one and simple. It responds everywhere to one and the same need, and is everywhere derived from one and the same mental state. In all its forms, its object is to raise man above himself and to make him lead a life superior to that which he would lead, if he followed only his own individual whims: beliefs express this life in representations; rites organize it and regulate its working. This passage sheds much light on the method of Mr. Eliot's Sunday Morning Service where the self-mutilation of enervate Origen is placed in the same lineage as the sexual origin of the Word, and where the initial sapient sutlers of the Lord who Drift across the window-panes is a passage with an ambiguous, or better ambivalent, reference, since it holds together in one term both the sable presbyters who bring offerings to church and the bees who bring pollen from one part of the  <head>plant</head>  to another and so perform the Blest office of the epicene.

Although it was T U C policy for member unions to refuse government money for ballots, a number of unions defied it. In 1985 the second largest union, the AUEW, was faced with the threat of expulsion from the TUC for breaking the policy. The Electricians Union was  prepared to follow the AUEW and, already faced with the breakaway Democratic Miners' Union in Nottingham, the TUC was forced to find a face-saving formula to avert a possible split. The electricians also incurred the displeasure of fellow trade union leaders by making no-strike agreements with employers, arranging private health care facilities for workers, and then secretly negotiating with the Murdoch press for jobs at the new Wapping  <head>plant</head> .

After he pulled out of the Ryman operation, however, he left manufacturing for good. I was quite sorry to do so because I liked the manufacturing process very much indeed, but I don't believe you can be both a manufacturer and a retailer.

When I became chairman of Hepworths, it had its own clothing  <head>plant</head>  and it either produced too much or not enough of the right quality at the right price at the right time. There's always an argument between your own manufacturing company and the retailing side. Another problem is that if you're trying to deal with other manufacturers in the way that we do, where we have this extremely close relationship and they are very reliant on our forward forecasts of volume, they feel if you have  your own manufacturing plant that you would always give preference to it in bad times and the other suppliers would be the people to suffer if sales declined.

Such a management style was by no means typical of Nigeria alone. Direct theft from the parastatal system was common in Tanzania by the 1980s. Thus in 1988 the Tanzanian Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee reported that about 5 million had been taken in 1987 in the form of outright theft from parastatal companies. If there is a prevailing thread in the history of these state-owned enterprises it is the constant under-assessment of risk  of the lack of imported materials to supply a manufacturing process, of failure in the supply of inputs ranging from petrol to fertilizer, of farming communities not producing the cash crops to keep a processing  <head>plant</head>  in operation, and of failing to find competent management for complex operations.

Not only was there overwhelming support on the picket line (from trade unionists and from many feminists who identified with the women's movement rather than any particular trade union) but on 15 June local postal workers at Cricklewood started a boycott of Grunwick mail.

Before describing the opportunities and shortcomings of such structures for conversion to domestic use, it is necessary to say something about the process of grinding grain to produce flour, because the anatomy of these buildings was dictated by this process. Corn-milling is one of the oldest and most necessary human occupations. The main good grains on which we depend for an essential part of our daily diet come from plants belonging to the family of grasses and cannot be readily digested until the tough outer shells are broken up and, sometimes, removed. A grain of wheat, for example, consists essentially of three parts: the bran, made up of several outer coverings, the germ (the embryo of the new  <head>plant</head> ) and the endosperm, the starchy centre which is made into flour.

NO LONGER can the Government disguise the crisis surrounding electricity privatisation. Ministers have already had to pull Britain's fleet of Magnox reactors out of the float and delay the sell-off date by up to six months.

After months of turning deaf ears to warnings by the City and industry, the Department of Energy has at last conceded that nuclear  <head>plant</head>  cannot be included in the share float without state support. This leaves the Energy Secretary, Mr John Wakeham, with two options: he can either agree to underwrite any cost escalations in nuclear handling costs after privatisation, or he can swallow his pride, and pull all nuclear plant out of the impending sale.

A report to be published later this month is understood to detail a series of shortcomings in the rushed sale of the motor company to the group which was approved by Lord Young, the former Trade Secretary. The company, with plants in the West Midlands, Oxford, Glasgow and Llanelli in south Wales, was sold for 150 million which British Aerospace later recouped by floating its half share of DAF-Leyland on the stock market. The report  which examines the civil servants' handling of the sale  is understood to question why British Aerospace was the only main bidder where detailed and full inquiries were made. It also looks at the potential profits which British Aerospace may be able to make by selling redundant sites in Llanelli, Bathgate in Glasgow and the Cowley  <head>plant</head>  in Oxford which is due to close in the 1990s.

Rover believes in catching them young as Judith Jackson discovered in Swindon The body shop Motoring. THE Rover  <head>plant</head>  at Swindon is not a pretty place. But behind this typical example of dreary industrial architecture, much is going on which should encourage us. For Rover is busy introducing young people to engineering. Engineering is not a glamorous pursuit, nor does Swindon produce the final glossy motor car which might lure potential workers. But the pressings which come out of the plant for Cowley and Longbridge are essential. In an area where unemployment struggles to reach 3 per cent, school leavers are spoiled for choice, so it is in a spirit of enlightened self-interest that the Swindon managers have embarked on programmes designed to tempt young people into engineering. Ray Fletcher, the personnel manager at Rover's Swindon plant and Graham Spaull, the training manager, are concerned that to many youngsters engineering means long hours, tedious jobs and dirty hands. Part of this myth is perpetrated by educationists who have been no nearer a press shop than a picture in a newspaper; parents also see their offspring in cleaner, more respectable jobs. So the success of 20 youngsters on a two-week work experience programme in the Swindon plant on Monday is crucial to the future of engineering in general and the motor industry in particular.

Declaring that the Department of Energy's about-turn will result in merely a temporary interruption to atomic development, chairman Mr Christopher Harding admitted that the nuclear industry's image has been damaged by fears about nuclear waste. Despite the wealth of evidence that nuclear power can never under-price fossil fuel-generated electricity, BNFL is looking at ways of competing for supply in the open market.

The new  <head>plant</head>  would have capacity of between 600 and 2,400 megawatts of power. The company is also planning to expand the life of the existing Magnox reactors by another 10 years.

Construction could be caried out as a joint venture with the new state-owned company set up to operate all existing nuclear plant.

But in order to fully answer the question what is aromatherapy?, we need to take a closer look at these amazing aromatic oils. ABOUT ESSENTIAL OILS Essential oils, or essences as they are often called, are the odoriferous, volatile (they readily evaporate) liquid components of aromatic plants. They accumulate in specialised cells or in specific parts of the  <head>plant</head> . They may be found in the petals (rose), the leaves (eucalyptus), the wood (sandalwood), the fruit (lemon), the seeds (caraway), roots (sassafras), rhizomes (ginger), resin (pine), gums (frankincense), and sometimes in more than one part of the plant. Lavender, for instance, yields an essential oil from the flowers and leaves. The orange tree is particularly interesting for it produces three different-smelling essences with differing therapeutic properties: neroli (blossom), petit-grain (leaves) and orange (rind). A plant produces essential oils for its own survival: to influence growth and production; to attract pollinating insects; to repel predators; and to protect itself from disease.

That Eden should have allowed the Cabinet a full and lengthy debate on 3 November 1955 could be construed as skilled management, and his referral of the issue for further thought to a Cabinet committee might be seen as prudent policy. His pattern of personal leadership, as revealed by the Cabinet committees he chose to chair himself, reinforces the standard interpretation of him as a man more at ease with overseas than with domestic policy. He followed Churchill's practice and allowed Butler, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to chair the Economic Policy Committee. Eden, naturally, took Churchill's place at the head of the Defence Committee, and the list of ad hoc committees he chaired reflects both his appetites and the intrinsic importance of their subject matter: GEN 502 on the supply of military aircraft; GEN 503 on security in Cyprus; GEN 506 on preparations for the meeting of foreign  ministers of France, the UK, USSR and USA in Geneva in October 1955; and GEN 511 on a third Indian steel  <head>plant</head> .

Last month ICI announced that its third Klea ICI 134a (HFC134a) plant will be built at Mihara, near Hiroshima in Japan. The plant will be built in partnership with Teijin, a long-standing joint venture partner of ICI in agrochemicals. The JV aims to link ICI's process technology and application expertise at its Japan Technical Centre at Tsukuba Science City with Teijin's production experience. The plant will have an initial capacity of 5000 tonnes pa when it comes on stream in 1993, supplying the Asia Pacific refrigeration markets.

For more than 50 years I have nurtured what might be called an insatiable interest in China and the arts, crafts, and accomplishments of the Chinese people, the oldest extant civilization on earth. Whether this burning interest came from a transmigration from a previous existence I do not know, but it may have been sparked off by a small and relatively insignificant incident which occurred in the spring of 1929. From time to time, and I think mainly to keep in touch, Aunt Janie would ring me to ask if I could come to the house to help with a small task, such as fixing the cellar door, hammering in a stray loose plank over the cistern and so on  although she must have known as well as I did how useless I was at such household chores.

A total of 22 552 workers were followed up on an average of 18.6 years. Overall mortality was 23% lower than the national average for all causes of death and 18% lower for cancer. For a small group of workers, however, who had experienced above average external exposure and had also been monitored for internal contamination by radionuclides, the mortality from cancer of the prostate gland and the lung was raised (Beral et al, 1988). In workforces in the USA, excess mortality from prostatic cancer has also been reported in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and in a weapon  <head>plant</head>  but, Beral et al continue, recent data from the Japanese atomic bomb survivors show no association between a single acute exposure to high levels of radiation and mortality from prostatic cancer. The authors indicate therefore that excesses of prostatic cancer in industrial workforces are unlikely to be due to external radiation. Cancers in other specific body sites were also monitored and compared with surveys from other countries but more research requires to be done. Certainly following the far-flung effects of the disaster at the Chernobyl nuclear power station in 1986, the health hazards associated with nuclear products have been highlighted, not only for employees and people in the immediate environs of a nuclear plant but also for people and terrain far distant from the scene of the nuclear leak.

Few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of Kamchatcka and caused no known casualties.

Although it is conceded that a decline occurred in a few trades, reformers are said to  have been confused by terminology and to have failed to distinguish between deskilling of individual jobs and industrial changes which led to the number of jobs in certain industries or occupations declining either relatively or absolutely, but not to the nature of the job themselves changing. Other writers have concluded differently, especially with reference to engineering, building, shipbuilding, and printing. Whatever the disagreements, it seems reasonable to say that the period circa  18901914 witnessed an unprecedented advance of machine technique and of mechanisation generally and automatism in particular.

Labour MPs and some key Conservative figures, such as Michael Heseltine and Leon Brittan, argued that a removal of the automatic grant would worsen regional imbalances (Duffy, 1988). Obviously, companies prefer automatic grant, but that is not a justification from the government's point of view (Begg and McDowell, 1987). This loss of automatic grant might prove particularly important when regions attempt to attract major international inward investments. The Nissan car  <head>plant</head>  near Sunderland is a notable example of this.

The apparently extreme view expressed by Masterman (1987) may perhaps be the public perception of local-authority services as a whole, but equally many people working in schools would also subscribe to this view when discussing the local education authority's administration of the education service. Any superficial investigation into the role of the education officer will dispel the view expressed by Masterman once some appreciation and understanding is gained of the day-to-day duties that are performed both in terms of strategic planning and institutional management. A view from county offices is equally, and often, a mirror image of the incoming vibrations.

In the Dinantian rocks which appear to form a major part of the leading Variscan thrust slice, the source potential of the limestones and dolomites (which represent shallow water facies) is assumed on the whole to be relatively low. The underlying Lower Limestone Shale is also interpreted as a shallow water sequence, but some beds are believed to have been laid down in poorly aerated conditions (George 1958) and may therefore contain source material. Further south, deeper water conditions, and hence the possibility of preservation of organic matter, persisted from the Devonian into the Early Carboniferous. During the Late Carboniferous the proliferation of  <head>plant</head>  growth on land not only provided coal seams but contributed abundant particulate and dissolved organic matter to the pro-delta and deeper marine areas.

Thus grassland (especially wet) is an important habitat for many specialised bird species, and its loss has reduced and restricted their populations. Other habitat losses have resulted from farm mechanisation which, requiring larger and more conveniently-shaped fields, has resulted in much hedge and scrub clearance.

There have been dramatic declines of a few bird species as a result of using some chemicals, and perhaps more subtle and long-term changes as a result of the simplification of the  <head>plant</head>  community of farmland arising from cropping changes and the widespread use of increasingly sophisticated herbicides.

Fritz Moeri, one of five people charged in the trial of company officials which began on 18 April, has told New Scientist  that the disaster would have been impossible if the system he built in 1970 had not been modified and if fashionable exhaust valves had not been added at the insistence of company management. The accident happened when workers at the ICMESA plant neglected to add water to stop a reaction producing trichlorophenol (TCP) as they went off shift early one Saturday morning. The reactor's contents spontaneously over-heated, expanded, blew valves on vents and emptied the contents of the cauldron into the air above the plant.

On 1 October the Italians proposed to the convention's scientific committee that the reactor pot, which was at the heart of the explosion, should be dumped, 700 km off the Spanish coast in the area used annually by Britain for dumping nuclear waste. But rumour is rife that the reactor pot has already been buried.

One activity that has already been set up is the international Intor workshop, in which groups from the US, Europe, japan and the USSR have met to establish a common set of objectives and an optimum design for demonstrating the technology needed for a fusion reactor based on the tokamak system. The International Atomic Energy Agency of the United Nations organises the Intor workshops (Intor stands for International Tokamak Reactor) although most of the work is actually carried out by groups working in their various home laboratories. The leading groups meet in Vienna periodically to bring the work together. The Intor workshop has already produced a first broad proposal a definition of the envisaged  <head>plant</head>  and its objectives. Intor is presently conceived as a 600 MW (thermal) reactor that would run for 10 years, researching and, we hope, demonstrating the practicability of repeated long pulses burning thermonuclear fuel in a tokamak. Intor could also test the life of components in the flux of neutrons  at an energy of 14 MeV  produced by reactions between deuterium and tritium. Such a device would become radioactive because of those neutrons and Intor would also have to demonstrate the practicability of maintenance by remote control. Intor would not produce electricity, that would come later in the so-called demonstration plant.

BY NOW Sir Frank Layfield QC will be well aware of the task that is before him. It is nearly a year and a half since David Howell, the then Secretary of State for Energy, announced that Sir Frank would be the inspector at the public inquiry into the plans of the Central Electricity Generating Board to build a pressurised-water reactor (PWR) at Sizewell in Suffolk, and there has been a veritable deluge of documentation from all sides in the past 18 months, giving Sir Frank more than enough preliminary reading. There are various theories as to how long the inquiry will last, ranging from four months to nine months, or even longer. The shorter estimate comes from one or two optimists within the electricity supply industry who believe that the opponents to the plans to build the Sizewell PWR will prove less persistent than they were at the inquiry into the plans to expand the nuclear fuel  <head>plant</head>  at Windscale in Cumbria.

This time the issue is the safety of the clean-up of the plant. During the past fortnight engineers working on the site have charged, in affidavits, that the efforts to remove damaged uranium fuel from the reactor are sloppy. The present mentality on the island emphasises short cuts, expedience and disdain for professional standard, said Edwin Gishel, engineering director for site operations in an affidavit sent last week to his employer, the General Public Utilities Corporation. And Richard Parks, an engineer with the Bechtel Corporation, which built the plant and is the prime contractor for the clean-up, claimed that the operation is disorganised and at times irresponsible.

Storage leaves open the option of reprocessing later, he says, if the value of the uranium and plutonium that could be reclaimed in the process, made it worthwhile. Deacon's plan would involve every nuclear power station in Britain becoming a mini-Windscale, storing many years worth of spent fuel on-site. But the CEGB prefers the idea of a central store. The board says it needs such a store in any case in the 1990s because there may be a shortage of reprocessing capacity at British Nuclear Fuels' Sellafield  <head>plant</head>  ( New Scientist , 3 February, p 289). But the new admission that Britain is considering (forgetting) about further reprocessing plant opens up the possibility that the temporary store may become a long-term dumping ground for the industry's most dangerous waste.

We know from Cato the Censor (234149 BC), the author of De agri cultura , that the various methods of planting, grafting, training and pruning of the vine, which the Romans would have introduced into Champagne, had been in common use throughout the warmer parts of the empire for at least two hundred years.

Archaeology, on the other hand, is the study of the past using objects and other excavated evidence as the main source of data.

The most diligent student of the region's past will find it extremely difficult to fix upon any period in earlier times in which the condition of the people can be seen as more attractive than the point reached by the early 1960s. The actual industrial structure of the mid-1960s, by which time the massive Robens-led reduction in mining employment was already underway, is given in Table 3.1 and compared with the situation in 1976 and 1986. The changes over the period 196676 are interesting. The transition from the post-war boom in traditional industries to a modernized branch  <head>plant</head>  structure occurred after the Hailsham Plan of 1963 and changed the nature of the origins of the region's economic problems from overspecialization by industrial sector (i.e. over-reliance on old basic industries particularly affected by changing market demands and the new international division of labour) into overspecialization by corporate function (i.e. under-representation of control and research and development functions).

Creating a vortex For waste collection in my workshop I use a Hoover Wet/Dry Powervac Super, fitted with a pleated paper drum filter and connected to my tools and machines with flexible hoses. I also use the vac in the garden, collecting leaves, grass and hedge clippings. But by using an auxiliary collecting  <head>tank</head>  I am able to increase the capacity by more than eight time, thereby avoiding having the empty the vac so frequently. I acquired a 1301 plastic tank (the kind with a removable lid which is retained in position with a ring clamp) and installed inlet and outlet hose sockets in the sides close to the top at diagonally opposite points. The hose sockets were the genuine parts supplied with the Powervac. These required a little modification to get a better fit around the radius of the tank, sealing with a glue gun. If ordinary drainage fittings are used it is vital that the inner parts of both inlet and outlet are passed through a 90 elbow to create a vortex. The tank's lid is so good that the suction is enough to seal it, with the ring clamp.

There's no need to nail the shelves down, as they can't move sideways because of the spacers.

However, outside your sitting room thousands of wartime military installations still survive as historically important reminders of Britain's epic struggle. Fighter and Bomber Command airfields, anti  <head>tank</head>  defences, gun emplacements, prisoner of war camps  and some 6,000 pillboxes still form part of the landscape in many areas of the country. In the heart of London's Whitehall visitors can explore the warren of cramped underground rooms and passageways which served as the nerve centre of Britain's war effort. Known as the Cabinet War Rooms, the complex has only been open to the public since 1983. Inside, one can still see the Map Room, where Churchill used to study the progress of the war, the Cabinet Room where many of the Second World War's most important decisions were made, and Churchill's personal accommodation from which he made several of his wartime broadcasts. In the space of 12 months the War Office built 25,000 pillboxes  almost a quarter of which still survive  and erected hundreds of miles of concrete anti-tank defences. On windswept lonely Chesil Beach  that great ten mile long pile of pebbles which stretches westwards along the Dorset coast from Portland  one can still explore the pillboxes and anti-tank defences which were built in 1940 to resist the threat of invasion. And later in the war, in 1943, it was this imposing natural wall of shingle which was used by the famous Dambusters as a practice target before their attack on the Mohne and Eder dams in Germany. Fifty miles inland, the remains of the wartime government's fall-back line of defence still survives, mostly along the line of the Kennett-Avon canal. Between Bradford-on-Avon and Reading are some 200 pillboxes built in 1940 to house mobile two pound anti-tank guns and machine guns in the event of invasion. The recesses in the pillbox floors where the guns would have fitted are still there today. The various different types of pillbox can be seen from the canal towpath. Larger scale gun emplacements, however, are much rarer. The only surviving group of such installations can be explored at Curry Mallet near Taunton, Somerset, where three large gun emplacements with three-foot-thick concrete walls were built to house six-pounder anti-tank guns with a range of half a mile.

The arch-conservative, Senator Jesse Helms (North Carolina), complained that the administration should have mobilised the US troops, based less than a mile from the Panamanian Defence Force headquarters, to help the rebels. Once again, we snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, Senator Helms said. The view on the left was that the Bush administration was more involved in the coup than it has admitted, but decided against a visible or military role for fear of the political consequences of failure and a heavy loss of American lives. Anyone who doesn't believe the White House was was deeply involved doesn't understand the magnitude of the President's obsession with Noriega or the way Washington works in these areas, said Larry Birns, director of the respected liberal think- <head>tank</head> , the Council on Hemispheric Affairs.

Soviet threat to 3bn pounds anti- <head>tank</head>  missile projects By MARK URBAN, Defence Correspondent BRITAIN'S plans for a new generation of anti-tank weapons, involving projects costing more than 3bn, could be thrown into turmoil after the discovery of new armour on Soviet tanks. Ministry of Defence sources say that two of the Army's three new anti-tank missiles will be ineffective against the frontal armour of new Soviet tanks. Warsaw Pact tanks have been fitted in recent years with additional armour, designed to explode when hit by an anti-tank missile, so neutralising its effect. This is called reactive armour. The Army's new anti-tank weapons are being designed with tandem warheads; the first explodes reactive armour and the second penetrates the shell of the tank. Now it has emerged that Soviet tanks are being fitted with two or three layers of the reactive armour, which probably renders the tandem warhead ineffective. Les Aspin, a member of the US Congress and chairman of the powerful Armed Services Committee, said he had a nasty surprise when he saw Soviet tanks fitted with the multi-layer reactive armour during a visit to the Ukraine in August. In the latest Jane's Defence Weekly, he says this discovery can't be anything but bad news to forces planning to defend against these tanks with current anti-tank weapons. The Army is taking delivery of LAW-80, a short range anti-tank weapon costing 400m. But it cannot penetrate the frontal armour of new Soviet tanks, MoD sources say. Britain is collaborating with France and West Germany, in a project called Trigat, to develop medium and long range anti-tank missiles. The cost to Britain is 780m and 1.85bn respectively. Medium range Trigat has been designed with a tandem warhead and is due to enter service in the mid-1990s. It will be ineffective against the multi-layer reactive armour, experts say. Long range Trigat is being designed to make a diving attack on the roof of a tank, where the armour is normally at its weakest. Explosive reactive armour, which is fitted in box-shaped panels, has been fixed to the turret roof of modern Soviet tanks. The long range weapon is not due to enter service until the late 1990s and may be delayed while scientists attempt to modify the warhead to defeat the multi-layered Soviet armour. Further delays could have a serious effects on Army plans to introduce a fleet of gunship anti-tank helicopters, for which the long range Trigat is intended to be the primary weapon. The MoD may be forced to incur further costs by buying another anti-tank missile as an interim solution until the long range Trigat is ready. Some officers familiar with the medium range Trigat project are sceptical that it can be modified to defeat the new armour. They believe Britain should pull out of the project and find another weapon to fill the same role. Reactive armour has hardly any effect on the solid, armour-piercing rounds fired from tank guns. The new development may strengthen, therefore, the case of those who back the early replacement of the Army's Chieftain tank fleet.

It can be applied to all kinds of objective situations or none at all. I am coming later to the none-atall which is one of the more emphatic observations that I have to make, namely that one must not assume there is necessarily a rational purpose, or even a felonious purpose, in the breach of law and order and the commission of crime. However, staying for a moment with hi-jacking, here we have a specialised form of the Breakthrough Phenomenon, which until the antidote is produced or produces itself, has quite startling pyrotechnic results, but collapses again as the antidote is devised. It is rather like warfare, the seesaw of offensive and defensive, of  <head>tank</head>  armour and the high-velocity penetrating bullet. In fact I think it possible that in the context of hi-jacking we are  developing the anti-tank weapon  one which is largely a moral weapon and lies mainly in the hands of political authority.

Where it should have tried harder, however, is with taming mechanical noise levels. The 24-valve engine is appreciably noisier that its 12-valve predecessor and although it invariably sounds good, its insistence can be a little wearing. Our overall consumption of 26.6mpg is a fine result given the zest with which the 325i performs and its relatively short intermediate gearing, though the best return of 27.9mpg suggests that some feather-footed tactics aren't as effective as some might expect. Even so, a significantly bigger  <head>tank</head>  than before (14.3 against 12.1 gallons) has pushed the range up to a very respectable 386 miles, based on a touring consumption of 27.0mpg.

For example it is reported that overstocking in litter-based poultry will result in an overloaded offensive litter; whilst understocking may also be undesirable, since this may result in a dry and dusty litter which may help disperse the odour over a wide area, unless dust filters are installed. With regard to the storage of manure, the effect on odour development depends on whether the manure is in solid or liquid form, and whether it is stored aerobically, that is with a sufficient supply of oxygen, or anaerobically, that is in septic conditions, in the absence of oxygen. Solid manure stores, carefully sited and tended, are less likely to give rise to nuisance problems than is liquid storage in the form of a slurry. It is usual for a crust to form on the surface of the storage  <head>tank</head> , the sludge settling to the bottom with the liquid in the middle. This crust prevents odours escaping and hence reduces odour emission. Unfortunately, its formation can cause problems, the solids sometimes remaining unpumpable on the bottom of the tank.

In particular, it attempts to assess how rational decision-makers will act in certain situations: It takes the tools of economics and applies them to the material of politics. By applying logical, deductive reasoning, economists try to work out what a rational actor would do to maximize his sic chance of getting what he wants (McLean, 1987, p. 1), that is, to maximize his or her utility. It is a very powerful weapon in the hands of critics of bureaucracy. Niskanen (1973) is probably the best-known proponent of public choice theory in the analysis of state bureaucracy, and a summary of his arguments, which are largely United States based, was presented to UK policy-makers through the Institute of Economic Affairs, a leading think- <head>tank</head>  devoted to spreading the message of economic liberalism and reform of the state.

It sounds most depressing. Supplementing this account of the College shortly after the Coleman regime comes one written late in life by Principal Simonds, describing the College and its environs in 18281829, when he was a student there. He notes that: the Institution was built in a Quadrangle Form, having now in the centre a large lawn or grass plot surrounded by posts and chains, and that between the Buildings and these a broad Pathway had been left, partly paved with stones used chiefly for testing the freedom from lameness of Horses sent for examination prior to purchase; as well as for ascertaining the progress of those under treatment in the Infirmary for lameness arising from various causes. In the central part of the Lawn, a Mound, planted with trees and shrubs, concealed from view a large Water- <head>tank</head> , protected by a strong iron grating. From this source the waterneeded by the whole Institutionis drawn, the supply to the tank being furnished by the New River Company.

During the 1960's Noam Chomsky popularised the view that human languages together share certain universal grammatic features, and that language is not learnt from scratch but rather acquired by brain centres sensitive to this underlying syntax. Since the anatomical asymmetries of human language areas first appear in utero , the implication is that preliminary stages of language acquisition could begin before birth. TECHNOLOGY Computerised  <head>tank</head>  outshoots its rivals THE Royal Ordnance Factory at Leeds yesterday delivered to the British Army the first production version of the Challenger tank, less than three years after the Ministry of Defence ordered the vehicle.The army is receiving more than 200 Challengers, costing about 300 million, to beef up its defences in Germany against Soviet tanks. The Challenger, with its Chobham composite armour, is the best-protected tank in the world and can also outshoot its  Eastern  -bloc counterparts. The MOD ordered Challenger when the tank that it had been developing, known as MBT80 turned out to be too complicated and expensive. Much of the development work that found its way into Challenger had been under way for some years on behalf of the Shah of Iran. After the Shah's fall, the Iranian government cancelled plans to buy more than 1200 Shir 11 tanks from the Leeds factory, which saw its order book fall from 1000 million to 30 million overnight. The Shir 11 was an improved version of the British Army's standard Chieftain tank. When MBT80 fell by the wayside, the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment at Chobham modified the design and came up with Challenger. Modern shells and anti-tank guided missiles can, if they hit a vulnerable point, penetrate the conventional hardened steel armour that protects Chieftain and its crew. The Chobham establishment therefore redesigned the hull and turret for the next version, Challenger. The new armour is heavy, and a Challenger weighs a massive 60 tonnes. Despite this, it is comparatively sprightly for a tank. The Rolls-Royce Condor diesel engine produces 900 kW of power, sufficient to drive the vehicle at more than 70 km/h across Salisbury Plain during trials last autumn. No previous tank could operate effectively at anything like that speed across rough country without the risk of injuring the crew. Challenger is the first tank with hydrogas suspension, which gives a much smoother ride. Challenger's 12 independent hydrogas units allow the wheels to travel up and down much further than with Chieftain's  bogie  -type suspension, thus greatly reducing the accelerations that the vehicle itself undergoes. Crew comfort is greatly improved as a result, and Challenger is a much more stable gun platform when firing on the move. A computer controls Challenger's gun, so it can shoot accurately at moving tanks, even when the vehicle is itself driving across country. Sensors on the tank measure wind speed and direction, air temperature and other factors that affect a shell's behaviour on its way to the target. The gunner looks through his optical sight, lines it up with an enemy tank and squeezes a trigger to fire a laser that measures the range. Information about the target's position passes automatically to the computer, which calculates where the gun should point so that its shell will hit the target. The computer then instructs motors to slew the turret and raise the gun barrel by the appropriate amount. Challenger has a good chance of hitting a Soviet tank with its first shell at a distance of more than 2000 m. The new tank's gun, of 120 mm calibre, is the same as that fitted to Chieftain. It will be more effective, though, thanks to a shell that has fins to stabilise it during flight. As the shell emerges from the gun barrel at more than 15000 m/s, aluminium petals peel away to reveal a long, thin tungsten-alloy rod with fins at the rear to stabilise it and thus improve accuracy. This long-rod penetrator punches a hole through the armour of an enemy tank, destroying equipment inside and killing or disabling the crew.

The only way to test these predictions in the space of a few years is to observe a sufficient number of protons and see if a few decay. The experiment in the Morton salt Mine in Ohio is one of a number set up around the world to do just this. The apparatus in the salt mine, designed mainly by physicists from the Universities of California (Irvine) and Michigan and the Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, is deceptively simple. A specially-mined hole lined with plastic forms a  <head>tank</head>  for nearly 10 000 tonnes of water, or in the region of 10 33  protons. The water is viewed by light sensitive detectors designed to pick up the so-called Cherenkov light emitted when electrically-charged particles travel faster than light does through the water. If a proton decays, its products should produce tell-tale patterns of Cherenkov light on the walls of the tank.

The list of diseases that slurry could spread is a formidable one, including anthrax and tetanus, but the one that receives most attention is salmonellosis. The institute reports that 10 per cent of cattle slurries and 23 per cent of pig slurries are contaminated with salmonellas  even if the animals themselves are healthy. Fortunately, salmonellas die rapidly in storage, although they can survive if the temperature stays below 10C, and if the slurry contains more than 5 per cent solids. After a month of storage in a  <head>tank</head>  or lagoon, the slurry should be safe enough for spreading  although cattle should not graze on it for a month.

Whilst the human studies had suggested a role for the hippocampus in the transition between short- and long-term declarative memory  a role supported by study of hippocampal lesions in monkeys  another facet of the hippocampus's role in memory was being uncovered in rats. Here, one of the striking effects of lesions is to affect the animal's capacity to learn spatial tasks  for instance to run mazes. Although this effect had been shown previously with more traditional maze-learning tasks, the best demonstration came in a test devised by Richard Morris, then of St Andrews, now at Edinburgh. The equipment consists of a circular, high-sided  <head>tank</head> , a couple of metres in diameter, filled with warm water which is made cloudy by adding some milk. The tank is located in a room whose walls contain recognizable  orienting cues; thus on the north wall there may be a clock, on the south a source of light, on the east an animal cage and so forth. At one point in the tank there is a shelf just below the water level, but invisible because of the cloudiness. A rat, put in the tank, swims at random until it locates the shelf, more or less accidentally, and climbs onto it. A video camera mounted above the tank can track the route taken by the swimming animal.

Indeed, I was far more worried than she because the Seayak she was using had no storage tanks (these are Prijon's replacement for the more usual bulkhead system, the latter being very hard to make watertight in plastic boats) and no pump. We would have had a real problem emptying the Seayak in that swell. X rescues or similar out because of the Seayak's loaded weight and bailing would have been a very frustrating experience beam on in that sea; a flexible hose from another boat's pump would have worked but mine was glassed in! So, I would want to test the storage  <head>tank</head>  and pump system (and the rudder assembly) before unreservedly recommending the Seayak even for short open sea crossings.

Relaxing music is played at the beginning of the float and again at the end to indicate your time is up. There's a light switch near at hand inside that tank and, as you are wearing ear plugs, you find yourself floating in a soundless, dark and warm environment. Jacqueline certainly found her float relaxing, I drifted in and out of awareness and felt stress and tension ease away, she explained. But I think anyone who's sensitive to enclosed spaces could find a flotation tank claustrophobic. But I personally would do it again. The Raphael Clinic,  .

One pitfall has been the temptation to adopt a lowest common denominator approach to unit length and course delivery, leading to a set of central modular regulations which, in their efforts to retain local features of individual cases, present the student with an overall scheme of mind-boggling complexity. There are several such phantom modular courses around, which in their presentation to applicants and to enrolled students of a unified title (Critical studies', Combined studies, etc.) imply promises (of internal transfer, for example) which they then cannot deliver.  Other key points within the conversion strategy include the implications for the course or department of opting in (what controls, for example, are relinquished over admissions, timetabling, examining, or future resource planning?) and the significance for contributing departments of continuing non-modular work. One possibility, usually disastrous for the development of the wider course in terms of resource constraints, is the header- <head>tank</head>  model, where departments with strong freestanding courses resource and develop these first before turning to the faculty- or polytechnic-wide scheme.

In 1914 he published a remarkable investigation into The Transportation of Debris by Running Water  and this included the results  of laboratory experiments. Gilbert is now acknowledged to have been a brilliant geomorphologist who made a contribution which anticipated many of the developments half a century later and whose deductions regarding stream and landscape mechanics have given new life to quantitative geomorphology in the twentieth century (Chorley, Dunn and Beckinsale, 1964, p. 572). A second  antecedent could be found in work by engineers, and R.A. Bagnold published his monumental Physics of Blown Sand and Desert Dunes  in 1941, in which he stipulated the bases for the underlying processes in desert areas. Bagnold subsequently worked on processes involving fluids other than air and contributed to understanding of beach formation by waves based upon wave  <head>tank</head>  experiments (Bagnold, 1940) and also to the analysis of fluvial processes (Bagnold, 1960) and in one of his last papers (Bagnold, 1979) he reviewed fluid flow in general.

In contrast to neighbouring Cuxton, where a most important Palaeolithic site was discovered in 1962, the prehistory of Hailing as known at present can only be shown to date from Neolithic, or New Stone Age, times. In this connection it is perhaps significant that the boundary between the parish and Snodland was the old track or Ridgeway, now largely destroyed by chalk quarries, which, keeping to the highest and driest line over the downs is thought to have formed the main east-west route at this period, crossing the River Medway at Holborough as Mr Margery suggested. Beside the Ridgeway and effectively parallel to it as a lower level ran the Terrace-way, here called by the later name of Pilgrims' Way, which passes through Upper and North Hailing to a crossing presumably in the Rochester area. Our earliest known inhabitant, Hailing Man, is now securely dated by the radiocarbon method to about 2000 B.C.

Individual workshops are relatively common, being identified by furnaces or industrial waste. Two examples can suffice. One is the second-century establishment at Godmanchester, manufacturing both iron and copper goods in a timber-framed workshop with an open front which contained four shaft furnaces and a bowl shaped smithing furnace. The other, at Ashton, is the second-century strip building with a wide entrance, which has been identified as a blacksmith's shop and contained five identifiable furnaces, a stone-lined quenching  <head>tank</head>  and numerous tools and completed metal objects.

This level of command was fixed ie as General Dwight Eisenhower you would not be expected to fly planes into combat, nor as the jockey of a M1 Abrams tank could you try and effect changes in grand strategy.

It was the first time that four large tanks  two crude storage, a ballast water and the Brent surge  had been taken out of service for planned maintenance in one year. The programme, which started in February, was handled by a taskforce of experienced operators, referred to on-site as Dad's Army. Many of the 16-strong team have now  or will have by the end of this month  taken early retirement. Mechanical contractors for the crude tanks 2045 and 2055 and the ballast water tank 3015 were Motherwell Bridge, the company which originally constructed the storage tanks. Motherwell Bridge's site manager Jim Anderson explained that his workforce of welders, platers and fitters peaked at 31, with subcontract work undertaken by tank cleaning contractor Caltech and painting contractor Wilkie Hooke. The job required 51,000 man-hours over a 28-week period, he said. Shetland Engineers Limited were involved with the Brent surge tank refurbishment.

Significant involvement of third parties, which increases the potential for errors, reduces security, and leads to increased costs.

Similarly, in Aldridge v. Johnson (1857 Q.B.) where the buyer supplied bags for the seller to put the goods (barley) into, it was held that property passed when the seller filled the bags. An easy and neat example of assent can also be found in the case of a purchase of petrol at a garage. If a petrol pump attendant puts the petrol into the customer's car, that is an unconditional appropriation to which the buyer's assent is clearly implied, Edwards v. Ddin (1976 D.C.). At a self-service garage it is the motorist who unconditionally appropriates the petrol by pouring it into his  <head>tank</head> , the assent of the seller being equally clearly implied.

As part of their 25th Anniversary celebrations the S.V.R. staged a gala steam weekend on 21-22nd September 1990. The large crowds present had a real feast of steam including some twelve trains per day each way and numerous engine movements at Bridgnorth as locos took their turns to take a train out or return with one from Kidderminster. Undoubtedly the visit to the S.V.R. of ex LNER No. 4472 Flying Scotsman was the star attraction, complete with plaque commemorating its record run on 8th August 1989 when on tour in Australia, of 422 miles non-stop from Parkes to Broken Hill, New South Wales, the longest non-stop steam hauled run ever. Also in steam were ex LNER No. 3442 The Great Marquess, ex Southern No. 34027 Taw Valley, ex GWR No. 7819 Hinton manor, ex GWR No. 2857 (heavy freight loco), ex GWR 2-6-2  <head>tank</head>  engine No. 4566, ex BR No. 75069 (class 4MT standard loco), ex LMS No. 8233 (class 8F Stanier), ex LMS No. 47383 (0-6-0T Jinty) and ex BR No.

 In order to reflect the aspirations of all the people for national reunification, stated Kim, we call for the total openness of both North and South, by crushing the barriers between North and South and realizing free and mutual visits. To this end he proposed that representatives from the two states hold top-level talks on dismantling the barriers within the heavily fortified Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) which had divided the Korean peninsula since the end of the Korean War in 1953. The South's initial response was to question the sincerity of Kim's initiative and to dispute the existence of the concrete wall to which Kim had referred in his speech as the symbol of national division. It was denied that any such wall existed on the southern side of the border, other than a series of anti- <head>tank</head>  defences well to the south of the DMZ.

Violent clashes between these white residents and the police reportedly resulted in injuries to nearly 100 people, including 16 police. The Quebec government ordered the Army to dismantle the barricades on Aug. 27, having refused to accede to the Mohawks' additional demands that they be treated as a sovereign nation during negotiations and be granted immunity from prosecution.

Increased spending was requested for major strategic weapons systems, including increases of 2,900 million for SSN-21 nuclear powered submarines, 1,600 million for the previously beleaguered anti-missile Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI), and 4,800 million for four more B-2 stealth bombers. The last two projects were expected to meet stiff congressional resistance. In addition the navy was to receive a new aircraft carrier and the army and air force would get the LH helicopter and an advanced tactical fighter aircraft, among a new generation of high technology systems expected to be partly financed by the termination of many existing systems. Programmes to be cancelled or phased out (subject to post-Gulf war evaluation) included the navy's F-14D fighter aircraft and Trident submarine, the airforce's Maverick missile and F-15E and F-16 fighter aircraft and the army's M-1  <head>tank</head> , Apache helicopter and Bradley fighting vehicle; the remaining two US battleships, Missouri and Wisconsin, were both set to be decommissioned in September 1991.

United States President Bush said on June 1 that an agreement in principle on Soviet compliance with the November 1990 Conventional Forces in Europe (CFE) treaty cleared the way for an important step towards a super-power summit. Earlier that day, US Secretary of State James Baker and Soviet Foreign Affairs Minister Aleksandr Bessmertnykh had met for talks in Lisbon, focusing on Soviet requests for economic assistance see p. 38272, on prospects for a Middle East peace conference and on the CFE issue. Neither Baker nor Bessmertnykh elaborated on how their CFE agreement was reached, but Baker stressed later that it respected the full integrity and credibility of the treaty. The US side had hitherto accused the Soviet military of evading the impact of CFE force reductions, in particular by transferring  <head>tank</head>  units east of the Urals (i.e. simply removing them from the area covered by the treaty, rather than destroying them see pp. 38027; 38122; 38217).

As the east European member states of the former Warsaw Pact and Council for Mutual Economic Assistance (CMEA, or Comecon) continued to experience severe economic difficulties in their transition to free-market systems, concerns were expressed during January and February at a series of incidents in which arms manufactured by those countries were supplied to Middle Eastern countries, apparently in contravention of the existing multilateral arms control provisions. German officials reported on Jan. 29 that a German freighter, the Godewind, bound from Szczecin in Poland for Syria, had been found to be carrying 16 Czechoslovak-made T-72 tanks for the Syrian armed forces, apparently in contravention of the Czechoslovak government's promise to end such transactions. The vessel was intercepted in the Mediterranean by the German navy and escorted to the German port of Kiel where its cargo was impounded. The incident aroused official protests from both Syria and Czechoslovakia, which claimed that the  <head>tank</head>  shipment formed part of a 252-tank deal approved by the Czechoslovakian authorities before the 1991 constraint agreement came into force. It was further reported on Feb. 2 that another 12 T-72 tanks had been loaded on a Danish freighter, the Nadia J, bound from Szczecin for Syria; it ran aground near the Danish port of Saeby and the tanks were seized by the Danish authorities, together with 46 tonnes of ammunition, on Feb. 3, giving rise to further protests from Syria. There were also persistent reports that Czechoslovak arms manufacturers were selling weapons to the Yugoslav federal forces, in contravention of UN policy. A Prague-based magazine, Respekt, reported in January that Yugoslavia was the intended recipient of some US1,500 million-worth of guns, rifles and anti-tank missiles ostensibly being sold to Nigeria.
